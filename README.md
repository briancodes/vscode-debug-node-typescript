# vscode-debug-node-typescript
VSCode setup for Node.js TypeScript file debugging - using 'task' and 'launch' configs for automatic in-IDE debugging

Requires an index.ts in src folder, and an out folder for the js and map.js files

F5 to start debugging
Ctrl+Shift+y to switch to Debug Console

Need to have a breakpoint in the index.ts for breakpoints in other modules/files to take effect
